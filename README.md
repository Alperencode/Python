# Python

Before get into my repository if you want to see my Python projects that specialized in specific subject you should check these repositories:

- [BeautifulSoup](https://github.com/Alperencode/BeautifulSoup) :  Web scraping and Data Analysis    
- [OpenCV](https://github.com/Alperencode/OpenCV): Face detection and kind of OpenCV programs
<br/>

## Repository Description

This repository contains my python files which is starts from 2018. Of course I made a lot of things that not included here but these are my codes that can properly called as python program. 

Python was my first programming language but I learned different programming language as well in my journey but **recently I'm focusing on python again to specialize in data analysis**. Because big data and making data meaningful was always caught my attention.

## Recently Update

Recently I'm working on a project about sending and reading MIDI signals with python. It's my intern project which you can find at [Lemona Science](https://github.com/Alperencode/Lemona-Science). So far I'm working on a GUI program which I made with Tkinter and I continue to develop it according to our needs.
