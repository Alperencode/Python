# Python

Before get into my repository if you want to see my Python projects that specialized in specific subject you should check these repositories:

- [BeautifulSoup](https://github.com/Alperencode/BeautifulSoup) :  Web scraping and Data Analysis    
-  [OpenCV](https://github.com/Alperencode/OpenCV): Face detection and kind of OpenCV programs
<br/>

## Repository Description

This repository contains my python files which is starts from 2018. Of course I made a lot of things that not included here but these are my codes that can properly called as python program. 

Python was my first programming language but I learned different programming language as well in my journey but **recently I'm focusing on python again to specialize in data analysis**. Because big data and making data meaningful was always caught my attention.

## Recently Update

Recently i'm working on configuring 'MIDI' files with python. I'll use this on my internship project. The repo i'm working on is currently private but i'll made it public when i finish the project.
