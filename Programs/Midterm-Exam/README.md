# Midterm-Exam

In this task, the following steps were performed:

a) Two CSV files, "turkey_cities.csv" and "2022_turkey_age_population.csv," were imported as dataframes df_1 and df_2 in order.

b) The two dataframes were merged using the merge function, and the resulting merged dataframe was named "df."

c) The datatype of each column of the merged dataframe except for the city was converted to the numeric integer type.

d) Three new columns were created to show the ratio of each age group among the total population for each city.

e) The code was written to output the cities for which the ratio of people over 65 is greater than the 0-14 ratio age group.

f) The code was written to output the first 5 cities with the highest ratio of young people in the total city population.

g) The code was written to print only the information for the user's city (MapRegion column from the excel).

h) The code was written to save the user's city data (row) alone as one CSV file.
